# thijsheijden-dotfiles
All the dotfiles I use to style my terminal, tmux and vim :)

Best way to install is backing up your old dotfiles in your HOME directory, then cloning this repository into your HOME folder, then running the install.sh script.
To use the install script, remove the old dotfiles from HOME. You might need to use source: ~/.vimrc in vim and run 'tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf' in the shell to get vim and tmux dotfiles installed.
